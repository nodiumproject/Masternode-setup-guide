# Nodium Masternode setup guide

> In this guide we will install a Nodium masternode the EASY way :)<br><br>
Let's get started!

## 1. Inital wallet setup
* 1.1 Download the [latest wallet](https://github.com/nodiumproject/Wallets) for your operating system which is available in our wallets repository.<br>
* 1.2 Launch the wallet and allow it to synchronize <br />
* 1.3 Click on `debug console` found in `tools`

* 1.4 Type `masternode genkey` - copy the generated key and exit the console<br />
Save the private key in a text file for future use.<br>
* 1.5 Go to `receiving wallets` found in `files` - create masternode wallet, by creating a new wallet, called `masternode1` <br />

Copy the address by right-clicking and selecting "Copy Address"<br>
* 1.6 Send EXACTLY 10,000 coins to `masternode1` wallet by pasting the copied address.<br>
Note that this has to be sent in **ONE transaction**. <br />
* 1.7 Go back to `debug console` and type `masternode outputs` <br />
* 1.8 Copy the transaction id and output id
Save the output in the text file for future use.

## 2. Get a VPS ( masternode server )
We recommend renting a VPS with www.vultr.com because they are fast and cheap.

Depending upon which operating system you are using follow the correct section:

### 3.1 Windows - [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

## 4. Masternode config file in the wallet

4.1 Go to `open masternode configuration file` in the wallet - found on the 'tools' menu <br />
   Here you will see the format and an example( these three lines are comments so they have no effect ) <br />
The format is like this:

```
# Masternode config file
# Format: alias IP:port masternodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index
# Example: MN01 127.0.0.2:51474 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0
```

4.2. Add your own real working node details under it. <br />
4.3. Put the masternode wallet name, i.e - `MN01` <br />
4.4 Put the server IP address ( your vultr ip or other vps/vm ip) followed by the port :6250 <br />
4.5 Put the private key generated in step 1.4 <br />
4.6 Put the transaction hash and output id from step 1.7 <br />
Example below

```
MN01 124.842.07.0:6250 119cCx5YeA519YkTzun4EptdexAo3RvQXaPdkP 838328ce57cc8b168d932d138001781b77b22470c05cf2235a3284093cb0019db 0
```

4.7 Once complete, save the file <br />

The file will look like this:
```
# Masternode config file
# Format: alias IP:port masternodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index
# Example: mn1 127.0.0.2:51474 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0
MN01 124.842.07.0:6250 119cCx5YeA519YkTzun4EptdexAo3RvQXaPdkP 838328ce57cc8b168d932d138001781b77b22470c05cf2235a3284093cb0019db 0
```
4.8 Restart the wallet<br>
4.9 Go to your wallet and go to the masternode page.<br>
* Select the masternode and press: "Start alias".<br>
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jXDVZqO.png)<br>

To verify that the masternode is running on the vps:
* Type: `cd ~/nodium/src`  ENTER
* Type: `./nodium-cli masternode status`  ENTER
* If you get this output you are done:<br>

<br>
If you followed these steps correctly your Nodium masternode should be running right now!<br>

# 5. Security

## 5.1 Wallet

Encrypt your wallet! This prevents other people ( who have access to your computer or get access to your wallet.dat file ) to get in your wallet. Don't lose that password. If you lose it the wallet is locked forever and nobobdy will be able to recover your funds.

Backup your wallet! The beauty of digital files is that you can back them up and store them somewhere safe. After encrypting your wallet make sure you back it up and keep it somewhere safe ( on a usb for example).

## 5.2 VPS

For the more advanced user I advise making your VPS more secure from all kinds of attacks. We don't want other people stealing our masternode right?
Please look at this guide http://patheyman.com/masternode-secure/ for more info.
